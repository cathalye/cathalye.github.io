Hello World!

This is my website. After procrastinating for a few YEARS, I made this in one afternoon on a particularly boring Saturday. Seems about right.

For a hot minute, I debated using Jekyll or Hugo, but after some tinkering, I finally decided to stick to vanilla HTML and CSS (for now?). Not that I know much about publishing websites, but I was highly inspired by this [post](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/) about making web pages that last. And I really wanted to keep it platform agnostic. As a bonus: this appeals to my side that has an on-and-off relationship with minimalism and my current love affair with markdown (thanks Obsidian!).

I'm still not sure if I want to make this a "public blog" but I do want an outlet for my musings. Document all the random stuff I read about on the internet. And maybe gain some clarity for myself in the process.
